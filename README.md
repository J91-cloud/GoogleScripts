## Google App Scripts Project
Inside this porject i have built various scripts that help me read the news. After subscribing to multiple news letters from various sources i have decided that it would be great to automate me receiving all the newsletters in one single document i can print out every night to help me catch up. 

The document in the form of a pdf also shows my days schedule, connecting with my google calendar api.
